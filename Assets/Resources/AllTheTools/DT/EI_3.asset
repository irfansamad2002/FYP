  Name: Periodontal Probe
  Icon: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 9aebd705574f9e642aef1e5f59b3e4d8, type: 3}
  Usage: '- To Evaluate the health of the periodontal tissues'
  InstrumentGrasp: "1. Position the thumb and index finger opposite one another on
    the handle, No touching or overlap \n2. Rest pad of middle finger lightly on
    side of instrument shank, touches ring finger \n3. Position the thumb, index
    and middle finger properly without hyperextension of joints \n4. Maintain a neutral
    wrist position"
  Instrumentation: "1. Insert at line angle, keep the tip in contact with the tooth,
    pressing down to touch the soft tissue base. \r\n2. Inititiate a series of short,
    bobbing strokes(walking stroke) toward the distal surface \r\n3. Walk the probe
    onto the distal surface until it touches the contact area \r\n4. Tilt the probe
    so that the tip reaches beneath  the contact area and gently press downward to
    touch the junctional epithelium \r\n5. Lightly insert down against the base of
    the sulcus and obtain a reading. \r\n6. Reinsert at the disto-buccal line angle
    in preparation for assessing the facial surface \r\n7. Make a series of walking
    strokes, moving in a forward direction toward the mesio-buccal line angle \r\n8.
    Tilt the probe beneath the mesial contact and assess."
