  Usage: Supragingival
  InstrumentGrasp: 1. Position the thumb and index finger opposite one another on
    the handle, No touching or overlap 2. Rest pad of middle finger lightly on side
    of instrument shank, touches ring finger 3. Position the thumb, index and middle
    finger properly without hyperextension of joints 4. Maintain a neutral wrist
    position
  Instrumentation: "1. Keep ring finger straight to support weight of hand and instrument
    2. Apply appropriate finger rest for the treatment area 3. Select and use correct
    working end for tooth surface (s) to be instrumented 4. Begin (and re-insert)
    at mesial/distal line angle with appropriate cutting edge 5. Establish and maintain
    correct face to tooth surface angulation-closed angle at 0-40\xB0 for insertion;
    open-angle at 60-80\xB0 for scaling 6. Maintain correct adaptation as instrument
    strokes progress around tooth surface; pivot and roll instrument as needed 7.
    Constantly maintain last 1-2 mm of cutting edge to tooth surface 8. Use short
    controlled calculus removal strokes in a coronal direction 9. Apply appropriate
    lateral pressure in a coronal direction 10. Demonstrate overlapping strokes at
    line angles and under the contact area 11. Use the appropriate sequence in the
    sextant"
