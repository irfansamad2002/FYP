  Usage: 'Supragingival. For anterior '
  InstrumentGrasp: "1. Position the thumb and index finger opposite one another on
    the handle, No touching or overlap \r\n2. Rest pad of middle finger lightly on
    side of instrument shank, touches ring finger \r\n3. Position the thumb, index
    and middle finger properly without hyperextension of joints \r\n4. Maintain a
    neutral wrist position"
  Instrumentation: "1. Keep ring finger straight to support weight of hand and instrument
    \r\n2. Apply appropriate finger rest for the treatment area \r\n3. Select and
    use correct working end for tooth surface (s) to be instrumented \r\n4. Begin
    (and re-insert) at mesial/distal line angle with appropriate cutting edge \r\n5.
    Establish and maintain correct face to tooth surface angulation-closed angle
    at 0-40\xB0 for insertion; open-angle at 60-80\xB0 for scaling \r\n6. Maintain
    correct adaptation as instrument strokes progress around tooth surface; pivot
    and roll instrument as needed \r\n7. Constantly maintain last 1-2 mm of cutting
    edge to tooth surface \r\n8. Use short controlled calculus removal strokes in
    a coronal direction \r\n9. Apply appropriate lateral pressure in a coronal direction
    \r\n10. Demonstrate overlapping strokes at line angles and under the contact
    area \r\n11. Use the appropriate sequence in the sextant"
